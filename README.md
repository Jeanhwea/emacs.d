## Reasonable Plugins

- magit: powerful git manager
- browses-at-remote: open github url on browser
- yasnippet: Aha, meet the snippet system
- smex: fast your M-x command
- evil: vim-style text editing
- helm: find anything, such as buffers, bookmarks, files and so on
- company: auto complete words according context
- exec-path-from-shell: load PATH from system
- expand-region: expand region increases the selected region by semantic units. Just keep pressing the key until it selects what you want. [video expamle](http://emacsrocks.com/e09.html)

## Personal Hobbits
